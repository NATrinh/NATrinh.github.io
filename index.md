I am a quantitative sociologist at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/) and [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/), and member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford.

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from an intra- and intergenerational perspective. I am interested in examining how disadvantage emerges within the family, develops over the life-course, and is transmitted from parents to children. Ongoing work investigates how social class structures earnings trajectories, the role of parental gifts and inheritances for wealth inequality, and social mobility among children of immigrants.

Previously, I was a research fellow at the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/index.html) and member of the Emmy-Noether Research Group [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng/research) at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en). I hold a DPhil in Social Policy from the University of Oxford. My doctoral research was funded by the German National Academic Scholarship Foundation.
