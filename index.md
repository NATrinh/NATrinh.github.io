Hi, I'm Nhat An. I am a sociologist at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/), the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/), and [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford.

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from an intra- and intergenerational perspective. I am interested in examining how advantage and disadvantage emerge within the family, develop over the life-course, and are transmitted from parents to children. Ongoing work investigates how social class structures earnings trajectories, the role of parental gifts and inheritances for wealth inequality, and social mobility among children of immigrants.

Previously, I was a research fellow at the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/index.html) and member of the research group [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng/research) at [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en). I hold a DPhil in Social Policy from the University of Oxford (2022). My doctoral research was funded by the German National Academic Scholarship Foundation.
