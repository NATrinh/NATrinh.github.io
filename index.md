Hi, I'm Nhat An. I am a sociologist at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en). I am also affiliated with the [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/) and an associate member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford.

My research investigates trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality, focusing on both intra- as well as intergenerational processes. That is, how advantage and disadvantage emerge within the family, develop over the life course, and are transmitted from parents to children. From 2025-2029, I am a principal investigator of the project [Wealth and Social Cohesion from a Relational Perspective](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-social-inequalities/skill-formation-and-labor-markets/projects/wealth-and-social-cohesion-from-a-relational-perspective) funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

Previously, I held post-doctoral positions at the Department of Social Sciences, Humboldt University Berlin, and the Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford. I obtained my PhD from the University of Oxford in 2022.
