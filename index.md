I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en) and member of the Emmy Noether Research Group [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng) at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en).

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from an intra- and intergenerational perspective. I am interested in examining how disadvantage emerges within the family, develops over the life-course, and is transmitted from parents to their children. Most of my work draws on large-scale, respresentative household survey data and has a comparative outlook. 

Before coming to Berlin, I completed a DPhil in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). My doctoral research was funded by the [German National Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) and won the Barnett Prize for best paper as well as the ISA RC28 Alan C. Kerckhoff Travel Award. I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses on quantitative methods, social policy, and intergenerational social mobility.
