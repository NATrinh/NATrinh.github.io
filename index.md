I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en) at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en). I completed my DPhil in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from an intra- and intergenerational perspective. Currently, I form part of the research group [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng) that investigates the accumulation and distribution of personal wealth within couples (PI: Prof Dr Philipp Lersch). Most of my work draws on large-scale, respresentative household survey data.

I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses on quantitative methods, social policy, and intergenerational social mobility.
