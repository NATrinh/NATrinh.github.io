I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Department of Social Sciences] (https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en) at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. I completed my DPhil in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention] (https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and [Wolfson College] (https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from both an intra- and intergenerational perspective. Currently, I form part of the research group [MyWealth] (https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng) (PI: Prof Dr Philipp Lersch) on personal wealth accumulation in couples that receives funding from the Emmy-Noether-Programme of the [German Research Foundation] (https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp). Most of my work draws on large-scale, respresentative survey data.
