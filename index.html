I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. I completed my DPhil in Social Policy at the Department of Social Policy and Intervention and Wolfson College, University of Oxford.

My research focuses on trends, causes, and consequences of social inequality from both an intra- and intergenerational perspective. Currently, I form part of the research group "MyWealth" on personal wealth accumulation in couples that receives funding from the Emmy-Noether-Programme of the German Research Foundation (PI: Prof Dr Philipp Lersch). Most of my work draws on large-scale, respresentative survey data.
